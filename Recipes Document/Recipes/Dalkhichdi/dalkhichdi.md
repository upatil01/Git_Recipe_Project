Dal Khichdi is a wholesome and comforting one-pot dish made with rice and lentils, typically seasoned with spices and served with ghee or yogurt. It's a popular dish in India and is often enjoyed as a comfort food. Here's a basic recipe for making Dal Khichdi:

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup rice
- 1/2 cup split yellow moong dal (lentils)
- 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)
- 1 small tomato, chopped
- 1/2-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala (optional)
- Salt to taste
- 4 cups water
- Fresh coriander leaves, chopped, for garnish (optional)
- Lemon wedges for serving (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Rinse and soak:** Wash the rice and lentils together under running water until the water runs clear. Soak them in enough water for about 30 minutes, then drain.

2. **Heat ghee or oil:** In a large pressure cooker or a heavy-bottomed pot, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat.

3. **Add cumin seeds:** Add the cumin seeds to the hot ghee or oil and let them splutter.

4. **Sauté onions:** If using onions, add them now and sauté until they turn translucent.

5. **Add ginger and garlic:** Add the grated ginger and minced garlic (if using) and sauté for another minute or until the raw smell disappears.

6. **Add tomatoes and spices:** Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy. Then, add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala (if using), and salt. Cook the spices for a couple of minutes.

7. **Add rice and lentils:** Add the drained rice and lentils to the pot and mix well with the spices and tomatoes.

8. **Pressure cook:** Pour in 4 cups of water and mix everything thoroughly. If using a pressure cooker, close the lid and cook for 2-3 whistles or until the khichdi is cooked and the rice and lentils are soft and mushy. If using a regular pot, cover with a lid and simmer on low heat for about 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the khichdi is cooked to the desired consistency.

9. **Serve:** Once done, let the pressure release naturally if using a pressure cooker. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves, and you can also squeeze some lemon juice over it if desired. Serve hot with ghee, yogurt, or pickles.

Dal Khichdi is a versatile dish, and you can adjust the spice levels and consistency according to your taste. It's a perfect comfort food for a hearty meal.
